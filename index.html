							<p class="card-text text-white">The main topic I learned from this lesson was working with audio tags and using JS to play the files. With audio tags, you're able to use .play() to play the file and work with .currentTime to specify where to start playing the audio. In addition, this lesson works with adding event listeners to the window to watch out for keydown events of specific letters to play the audio, as well as cause certain CSS changes to highlight the key pressed on the page.</p>

							<p class="card-text text-white">Once the hands of the clock are set up, this lesson focuses on using the current time to determine where the hour, minute, and second hand should go. In order to do this, I learned to use the CSS transform by rotating the hand based on the respective hour, minute, or second it is. Once the function to complete this is written, a setInterval is used to grab the new time every second, so the clock updates every second. Working with dates/time has always been difficult, but this lesson wasn’t too bad. Also, this lesson teaches about cubic-bezier, which is the animation effect of the tick-tock. </p>

								Day 3 - CSS Variables
							</h5></a>
							<p class="card-text text-white">
								CSS variables are great tools that can be used to manipulate the styling of a page using JavaScript. This lesson focuses on the syntax of variables, using two dashes before the variable name (i.e. —base) and using var() to access the value in other areas (i.e. background-color: var(—base);). For this lesson, the goal was to use sliders on the page to alter the spacing, blur, and border color of an image. Adding event listeners to the sliders and setting the style property with specific syntax is practiced in this lesson to give it the functionality. This lesson also introduces to dataset attributes in the HTML tags, which can be accessed using JavaScript (i.e. data-sizing=‘px’ can be accessed with JS using .dataset.sizing).

								Day 4 - Array Cardio Day 1
							</h5></a>
							<p class="card-text text-white">
								While this day focused heavily on using array methods, there was still so much to learn. For most of these array methods, I already feel pretty comfortable with (such as .filter(), .map(), .sort(), and .reduce()). However, this lesson goes into different scenarios where it might be a little tougher to complete the exercise. For example, sorting an array of people by last name where the array of names is a string listed like ‘lastName, firstName.’ The best way to work with this would be to split the string and focus on the last name and sort it afterwards. The lesson also goes through an interesting way to reduce an array of words by adding the instances of each word. The key to this would be to start the accumulator as an empty object and work with it as an object.

								Day 5 - Flex Panel Gallery
							</h5></a>
							<p class="card-text text-white">
								CSS has always been something the I struggle with and this lesson really tested me on it. In order to get the animation effect, a lot of adjustments were needed to center the words on the page and to create flex grids for each respective word. Once established, a transform: translateY style is added to the top and bottom word so it does not show on the page. However once clicked, JavaScript is used to listen to the event to add the .open-active class, which will re-style the transform: translateY so it animates and shows on the page again. With this, the panel will have an animated panel expansion as well, which uses flex to reshape the panel.

							</h5></a>

								This was a functionality I really wanted to include in my final project. While I was looking for resources in React to implement this, this lesson was to complete it in full JavaScript. Once an array of objects of cities have been fetched, event listeners are added to the input to listen for value typed in by the user. As the user types each letter, a new RegExp object is used to search through the array of any matches to the input for both the city or the state. Once these matches are found, these are displayed as a list using CSS.

								Day 8 - Fun with HTML5 Canvas
							</h5></a>
							<p class="card-text text-white">
								I’ve only worked with HTML canvas when working with Chart.js for my fourth project at Flatiron. Having no experience with it prior, I didn’t fully understand how it worked. With this lesson, I finally understand some of the technical aspects of it, such as setting a context for the canvas in order to create something on it. With context, so much can be used to create the paint-like brush above (such as using .strokeStyle, .lineJoin, .lineCap, etc.) All of these work together with event listeners with the mouse to create the effect it does. In order to make the multicolor design, the css function hsl() was used (which stands for hue- saturation-lightness) in combination with JavaScript event listeners to change the values of the attribute. I’ll definitely be practicing this as there’s still so much to learn with this.

								Day 9 - Dev Tools Tricks
							</h5></a>
							<p class="card-text text-white">
								Through my coding journey so far, I’ve only used console.log() to log messages in the console. It wasn’t until this lesson where I found out there are so many other methods you can use in the JavaScript console. For whatever reason someone might use these, they’re pretty cool ways to use the JavaScript console, especially when warning users and showing errors in the console. My favorite would have to be console.table() to create readable tables of arrays and objects.

								Day 10 - Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes
							</h5></a>
							<p class="card-text text-white">
								Outside of the array cardio days, this lesson was one I felt pretty comfortable with. Before tackling this one, I played around with GMail’s checkbox features to try to emulate the same functionality. At first, I had the window listen for a keydown of shift, but this lesson teaches that the click event has a .shiftKey with equates true or false on if the shift key is being pushed. Also, reference variables would be needed in order for the page to remember which checkbox was last clicked on and if that box was either checked or unchecked. That way for the next click, it was create the same functionality for that box and everything else in between.

								Day 11 - Custom HTML5 Video Player
							</h5></a>
							<p class="card-text text-white">
								This was another fun one to play around with since we’re using another media tag. Just like with the audio tag in the first lesson, this lesson focuses on the video tag, adding a volume control and speed sliders, along with a video scrubbing and time skips for the video itself. For the volume slider, I knew that that where the pointer ended on the slider would determine the percentage volume, but I had to learn about .currentTime and .duration for the video tag to calculate it. This would work exactly the same for the scrub bar, but using a combination of mouse events to determine where the user is at on the bar. The other features were pretty simple once I learned more about what was available to the video tag (such as .play() and .pause() to play and pause the video, as well as .paused to determine if the video is paused.).

								Day 12 - Key Sequence Detection
							</h5></a>
							<p class="card-text text-white">
								Growing up, the Konami Code was something that was memorized in my household. It was so important to get those extra 30 lives for Contra, or else you’ll never have a chance to beat the game. Regardless, I never did, but this code will be engraved in my brain for the rest of my life. For this lesson, it knew that the window would have an event listener for the keydowns of each key. What I learned from the lesson was how to store that information and to look for the EXACT order of the keydowns. The secret code would be stored in the script and each keydown would be pushed into an array. This array would always have at most the same amount of keys as the secret code. After each key down, this array would be compared to the secret code (using a .join() since two arrays cannot equal each other). If they match, then something will happen! While we don’t get extra lives by entering the code here, we do get a nice surprise.

								Day 13 - Slide in on Scroll
							</h5></a>
							<p class="card-text text-white">
								This was a fun exercise the practiced with detecting where the page was at with scrolling. While the lesson already came with a finished function for debounce(), it was an important concept to learn about. Since the event listener is detecting the scrolling on the page, it can fire many times while a user is scrolling. The purpose of the debounce method is to limit the number of times it listens for the event, thus assisting with page performance. While added the classes to the images to animate the slide-in feature, determining the point at which they slide in was the difficulty. This lesson also uses a combination of .scrollY, .innerHeight, .height, and .offsetTop to determine where certain aspects are located, such as halfway through the image, bottom of the image, and to determine whether the image is half shown or if the user scrolled past the image.

								Day 14 - JavaScript - Reference VS Copy
							</h5></a>
							<p class="card-text text-white">
								References vs copying is always so confusing when it comes to JavaScript. Sometimes we want to manipulate something, but not alter the original, yet it still does. Why? It depends on which one you are trying to change. When it comes to strings, numbers, and booleans, these changes are usually fine. When it comes to arrays, it gets a little more confusing as it creates references. Meaning, making changes to one array will affect the other. There are numerous ways to make a copy of an array (i.e. using .slice(), .concat(), or using the spread operator. The same issues arise with objects, which also has number ways to make a copy (i.e Object.assign() and the spread operator). One thing to note that these copies only go one level deep. Meaning that if an array is an array of arrays or an object is an object with objects, the sub-arrays & sub-objects will be references and will also both the copy and the original sub-arrays & sub-objects.

								Day 15 - LocalStorage and Event Delegation
							</h5></a>
							<p class="card-text text-white">
								I’ve briefly used localStorage during dev bootcamp, mostly to handle user authentication and store JSON web tokens to persist log ins. However, there’s so much more to it with persist all sorts of data. With this lesson, we are creating a tapas list with a checkbox for done (which is similar to creating a to-do list). Creating the to-do list using the form on the pages is fairly simple, using forms and input, type checkbox. What we are trying to persist is the list, or array, of tapas names and whether or not they’re done. LocalStorage is a set of key/value pairs and has it has functions like .getItem(key) and .setItem(key, value) to utilize. However, the values in localStorage can only be strings. So in order to store arrays/objects as strings, we’d use JSON.stringify() to store & JSON.parse() to pull the items from localStorage. With storing the state of the checkbox, we would add the event listener to the ul tag itself because the li tags in the list is constantly changing. With that, you can use attributes (such as index) in the HTML tags to access the item in the items array, make the change to “done” and re-store the data to localStorage.
