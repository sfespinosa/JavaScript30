    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log('running age = 200')
    console.log(age, age2);
    console.log('strings, numbers and booleans are okay if changing the original')

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log('team array', team)
    console.log('players array', players)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    players[3] = 'Lux'
    console.log('running team[3] = Lux')
    console.log('team array', team)
    console.log('players array', players)
    console.log('const team = players creates a reference. changes to one will affect the other')

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    console.log('ways to copy an array:')
    console.log(
    'const team2 = players.slice(),', 
    'const team3 = [].concat(players),',
    'const team4 = [...players]'
    )
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    console.log(person)
    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    console.log('ways to copy an object:')
    console.log(
    'const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });', 
    'const cap3 = {...person}')

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    // console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    // const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    const dev2 = {...wes}
